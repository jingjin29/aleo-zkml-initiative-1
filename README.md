## aleo-zkml-initiative-1

> **Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning** *(ZKML)* is  concept that marries the realms of privacy-focused cryptographic techniques and machine learning. Aleo, a zero-knowledge blockchain, contributes to the ZKML space by providing a platform to develop private applications. With its unique programming model, developers can write privacy-preserving, verifiable computations with ease, which are then compiled into zero-knowledge proofs. In the context of ZKML, Aleo can enable the training and execution of machine learning models in a zero-knowledge environment, ensuring that no information about the data, apart from the output, is revealed. This is a big step towards privacy-preserving AI/ML solutions.

STAKEME took part in the zkml-initiative-1 hackathon and the work was done in two sections: **zkML Algorithms** and **Python Developer Tooling**
